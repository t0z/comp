> Hey netsec folks, it's been a while since my last blog post, so I decided to release a new tool ;)
I think that we need more articles about "DNS hacking", I hope that you will learn something new here.

> For most mobile app developers, password management has as much appeal as a visit to the dentist. You do it because you have to, but it is annoying and easy to screw up, even when using standard libraries or protocols like OAUTH.

+ [The many ways of handling TCP RST packets](https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2016-02-01-tcp-rst/)

> What could be a simpler networking concept than TCP's RST packet? It just crudely closes down a connection, nothing subtle about it. Due to some odd RST behavior we saw at work, I went digging in RFCs to check what's the technically correct behavior and in different TCP implementations to see what's actually done in practice.

> The library is coded in C++ and provides all the facilities required to instrument binary libraries during runtime. It includes support for both 32 and 64 bit applications and it implements the interception verifying different situations that can crash the process. If you need to intercept any Win32 functions or any other code, this library makes it easier than ever.

__windows,adblock,enterprise__

> Blocking advertising has multiple security and performance benefits to clients. Ads are especially dangerous to corporate computers, which often run outdated plugins that can be exploited by malvertising. Most people immediately jump to thinking they need Firefox or Chrome to do this. However, did you know Internet Explorer has adblocking built-in? The feature is called "Tracking Protection Lists," and while not as powerful as a full adblocking extension, it is very effective.

__ukrain,powergrid,attack__

> After analyzing the information that has been made available by affected power companies, researchers, and the media it is clear that cyber attacks were directly responsible for power outages in Ukraine. The SANS ICS team has been coordinating ongoing discussions and providing analysis across multiple international community members and companies. We assess with high confidence based on company statements, media reports, and first-hand analysis that the incident was due to a coordinated intentional attack.

__madprotect,malware,netwire,packer__

> Some weeks ago we stumbled on a packer that our tools could not break. Surprisingly, this is actually not that common since most of the malware in the wild uses some sort of RunPE technique which is relatively trivial to break using simple memory tracing.

__secure,service__

> Keybase is more than a website. If you're comfortable working in a terminal, you should install the keybase command line program. You can do so much with it: sign, verify, encrypt, generate messages, sign code, move keys around, etc., all using GPG for the crypto.

> If you read our release notes frequently, you might have noticed that I tend to explain the background behind the changes in Wine Staging as I imagine that this might be interesting for some of our readers. However, those explanations do not really belong into the release notes, so I decided to move them to separate blog posts. So welcome to my first blog post in which I explain how the 16 bit support works in Wine and which typical bugs you may encounter. I hope you enjoy reading it although it is going to be very technical, but maybe you learn something from it :-).

> The Intel BIOS Implementation Test Suite (BITS) provides a bootable pre-OS environment for testing BIOSes and in particular their initialization of Intel processors, hardware, and technologies. BITS can verify your BIOS against many Intel recommendations. In addition, BITS includes Intel's official reference code as provided to BIOS, which you can use to override your BIOS's hardware initialization with a known-good configuration, and then boot an OS.
